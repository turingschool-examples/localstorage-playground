# LocalStorage Playground

A practice repo for M1 students learning to work with localStorage and JSON

## Instructions

1. When a user clicks the “Add Contact” button, their name and email should be stored as an object in localStorage
2. When a user clicks the “Display Contact” button, their name and email should be pulled from localStorage, and displayed in the .display-area section (NOTE: The HTML structure for this is up to you!)
3. BONUS: How could you add and display multiple users instead of just one? - Answer = That would be by iterating over the multiple values of the localStorage
